        <p> Interesting Facts about cicada</p>
           <p> Cicadas are one of the most common species of cicadas found in the United States.
             Research has shown that they use a specific mating call in order to attract females in hopes of 
             performing reproduction. The sound is created by the panels beneath their wings, known as tymbals. 
             The panels vibrate rapidly, and the sound is then intensified by the cicadaâ€™s mostly hollow abdomen.
              The main mating call is a high-pitched drone that lasts about 15 seconds, starting off softly and 
              gradually growing louder into a crescendo, and then tapering off by the end
